## Tutorial Manager

`TutorialManager.cs` is the brains of the whole thing. 

## Steps

Desktop and Mobile each have their own set of steps as mobile generally requires extra tabs to be opened and has slightly different text to display. Other than that the steps work the same way for all situations.

`TutorialStep.cs` is a `ScriptableObject` and contains the instantiation of `TutorialCallbacks` and `TutorialConditions`.
