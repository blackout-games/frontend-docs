<h2 id="purpose-of-this-proposal">Purpose of this proposal</h2>

<p>Having a clearly defined Git branch/commit model as well as a clean and sensical Steam releases will help with consistency for developers, the stability of our product, and mitigate the risk of critical bugs making it to the final product affecting the user’s experience as well as our ability to monetize.</p>
<h2 id="notes-on-the-language-used">Notes on the language used</h2>
<p>Due to limited resources, it is not a good idea to have any hard rules that could restrict development. For this reason, any time strong language such as ‘must’, ‘only’, etc. is seen it can be assumed that it excludes exceptional circumstances. When breaking one of these ‘must’ rules it is to be done with the understanding that there was no other option and ‘what’ and ‘why’ should be communicated well via Slack so that anyone who would need to know can access that information.</p>
<p>‘Critical bug in release’ is one or more of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Causing the game to crash</li>
<li>Prevent a user from progressing</li>
<li>Offensive content</li>
</ul>
<p>‘Complex patch in release’ is one which requires more than one commit.</p>
<ul>
<li>‘Critical bug in nightly’ is one or more of:</li>
<li>Unable to launch the game</li>
<li>Offensive content</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="steam-releases">Steam Releases</h2>
<p>Steam releases should be driven by necessity and not by what git branches exist.</p>

<h3 id="working-branches">Working Branches</h3>
<p>Working branches can be branched from Master for making new features, or from Release-Patch for more complex. Working branches should have descriptive names. Working branches should be frequently updated with any changes in Master to minimize time spent with merge conflicts later.</p>
<h2 id="merging">Merging</h2>
<h3 id="best-practices">Best Practices</h3>
<ul>
<li>Update working branch first: When merging branch A into branch B, branch B should first be merged into branch A and all conflicts resolved and functionality tested before continuing with the A into B merge. This is particularly important when prefabs are merged or overwritten as problems with prefabs are hard to fix after the fact.</li>
<li>Test your local branch well: When merging into a branch that others are working from, ensure that there are no compile errors, everything is running fine in the editor, and if there are a lot of, or large, changes then think about running a build.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="merge-requestsmr">Merge Requests(MR)</h3>
<h4 id="in-general">In General</h4>
<p>MR based deployment enables easy peer-review of the code/design. Instead of pushing directly through to a branch that others may be relying on, everyone can comment on the changes and ask questions before merging any piece of work.</p>
<p>MRs must be made via the GitLab website.</p>
<h4 id="for-release">For Release</h4>
<p>The Release branch is a production-ready branch and the only commits on Release come from MRs. Instead of pushing directly to Release, changes are made in other branches and then MRs are made to Release.</p>
<p>At least one other developer needs to approve an MR on the release branch.</p>
<h4 id="voluntary-mrs">Voluntary MRs</h4>
<p>Making MRs to Master is not required or forced but is an option if a developer feels as though they would like to have their work checked over by another developer.</p>
